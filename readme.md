## Usage

Upon opening the app, your chatbox should be highlighted to show that it is now watching for clue scroll solve messages.

Make sure you have timestamps enabled in your in-game chat. The app uses timestamps to make sure it doesn't split twice for the same kill timer. This can be done in the Settings under *Chat & Social* -> *Chat Customisation* -> *[Local timestamps in chat box](https://i.imgur.com/Tbry2Rp.png)*.
